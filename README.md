Awesome Robotics Conferences
============================

[![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

This is a list of robotics conferences, both academic and business. As the field is growing so rapidly, I've borrowed from @kiloreux Awesome-Robotics and focused/expanded the list just for conferences. I've attempted to add H Factor from Google Scholar and CCF for Chinese scholars where available (borrowed from @JackieTseng of TCVIL Tsinghua Computer Vision and Intelligent Learning Lab).  

It's an attempt to gather useful material in one place for everybody who wants to learn more about the field. Contributions welcome!
